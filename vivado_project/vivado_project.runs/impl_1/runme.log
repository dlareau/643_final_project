WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net design_1_i/top_0/inst/INPUT_FSM/ns_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/top_0/inst/INPUT_FSM/ns_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/top_0/inst/INPUT_FSM/ns_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
